<p>For my senior project, I will create a fantasy game based on Zelda.<br>
This was created in Python primarily through the use of PyGame.<br>
Run in terminal with python3 main.py<br>
Note: This project was heavily inspired by a ClearCode tutorial on YouTube.</p>

<p>To play, use the WASD keys to move around.<br>
Press SPACE to use weapon, and Q to switch weapons.<br>
Press R to use magic spells, and E to switch spells.</p>
