# Senior-Project

<p>For my senior project, I will create a fantasy game based on Zelda.<br>
This was created in Python primarily through the use of PyGame.<br>
Install Python and Pygame using pip install pygame.<br>
Run in terminal with python3 main.py<br>
Note: This project was heavily inspired by a ClearCode tutorial on YouTube.</p>

<p>To play, use the WASD keys to move around.<br>
Press SPACE to use weapon, and Q to switch weapons.<br>
Press R to use magic spells, and E to switch spells.</p>

<p>Press P to pause and open the upgrade menu.<br>
Use the arrow keys to switch through the menu boxes.<br>
Press SPACE to upgrade stats for the selected menu.</p>

<p>The goal of the game is to gather EXP points by killing enemies in<br>
front of you using magic and weapon choices. Once your health turns to 0,<br>
the game closes.</p>

<p>Note: For code that takes in a specific file, I had to use my own directory<br>
to access that file. Else I get a FileNotFoundError. If the game is ran by<br> 
someone else, then you might have to change the directory path to access<br> 
the specific image/sound files.</p>
